Donate blood to maximize the inventory of all blood types. Do not have any patient die or waiting outside the clinic.

Goal: type O- is the least since it's the most used (universal compatible)
types O+, A-, B- should be equal amounts (4 compatible types)
types AB-, A+, B+ should be equal amounts (2 compatible types)
type AB+ is the most since it's only used by type AB+.
